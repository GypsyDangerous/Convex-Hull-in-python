# Convex Hull in python

## Files
* convexhull.py - the file that contains the quickhull algorithm and example
* pyvector.py - contains a vector class that acts very similar to processings PVector or p5's p5.Vector
* misc.py - contains some miscellaneous functions that I use often in my programs

## how to use
